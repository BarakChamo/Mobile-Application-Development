## How to Use Git (and GitHub)

Git is a popular code sharing and collaboration system that we'll be using in this class. 
It allows for simloutaneous collaboration on a single codebase, version management and feature branching
and is the defacto way of working together on code-based projects.

As you are reading this on GitHub, it's clear that we'll be using GitHub as a git service provider.
So, the first step is to open a GitHub account [here](https://github.com/join).

### Navigating the repository on GitHub
The GitHub page for the repository mirrors the file structure of the root repository folder.
you'll be able to see all the files on each branch and many files have dedicated file viewers 
so you'll be able to read through highlighted code, view markdown documents, images and even 3D models.
