## How to Use Git (and GitHub)

Git is a popular code sharing and collaboration system that we'll be using in this class. 
It allows for simloutaneous collaboration on a single codebase, version management and feature branching
and is the defacto way of working together on code-based projects.

As you are reading this on GitHub, it's clear that we'll be using GitHub as a git service provider.
So, the first step is to open a GitHub account [here](https://github.com/join).

### Navigating the repository on GitHub
The GitHub page for the repository mirrors the file structure of the root repository folder.
you'll be able to see all the files on each branch and many files have dedicated file viewers 
so you'll be able to read through highlighted code, view markdown documents, images and even 3D models.

To 'clone' a repo to our local machine, click `Clone or Download` and copy the repo link.

### Option 1: Using the GitHub Desktop client
If you don't feel like using the git command line interface, you can use the GitHub Desktop client - [download it here](https://desktop.github.com/).

To clone the repo follow these steps:

#### 1. Login to your GitHub account
Using GitHub Desktop requires a GitHub account, create one if you haven't already and log into the client.

#### 2. Clone from internet
Choose the `Clone repository from the internet`.

In the popup window, select the `URL` tab and paste link you copied previously, also specify where the files should be cloned on your local computer.

Press `Clone` to clone the repository to your computer.
The files will now be available in the folder you specified.

#### 3. Fetch updates
To get the latest updates to the repository press `Fetch origin`.
This will update the local repository with all updates from the remote one.
