## How to use Terminal

Terminal, or `bash`, or `command line`, is the command line interface used to execute scripts and commands
in both Windows, Mac and Linux. You'll use to do anything from cloning repositories, running servers and
installing coding libraries and extensions.

But, before doing any of these things, it's important to know how to navigate the terminal.

### 1. On OSX open the `Terminal` app, on Windows use a `bash` compatible alternative.
I like using `Commander` or `Cmder`, it's a free `cmd` replacement that comes with Git preinstalled.
You can download it [here](https://cmder.net/).

### 2. optional - set `Cmder` to bash mode (Compatible with Linux and OSX Terminal)
Right-click the cmder window icon and open the `Settings`.
