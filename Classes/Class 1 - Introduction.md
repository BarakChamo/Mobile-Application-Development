## Class 1 - Introduction

In this class we'll be learning how to build cross-platform mobile applications using [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/), a framework developed and maintained by Facebook.

Using React Native will let us use JavaScript to build native-quality applications using a language we know, and deploy our apps to both Android and iOS with minimal effort or changes to code.

To run our code and manage the development environment we'll use [Expo](https://expo.io/), a project built on top of React Native that provides advanced runtime tools and utilities for sharing, testing and publishing code (such as a nifty QR code based mobile testing app and 1-click app publishing).

Let's get started using Expo!

(before we get started though, follow the setup steps detailed in the assignment below)


#### 1. Test an example `Expo Snack` on your phone

#### 2. Create a local blank project and test it your phone


### Resources


### Assignment - prep
For next week, please install all the prerequisite tools and software to be ready to begin mobile application development on your computer and phone.

These tools will facilitate modern, iterative application development on both your computer and your phones and allow you to debug, test and publish you applications easily.
